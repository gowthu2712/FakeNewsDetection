# FakeNewsDetection

### ABSTRACT

Owing to the growing popularity of social media, spammers have made these their prime target to mislead others with an intent to make financial or political gains. In this work, we have developed a fake news detection system which allows users to filter and flag potentially deceptive information. The prediction that a particular news article is deceptive is based on the analysis of previously seen news as well as information available online from reliable sources. A scarcity of deceptive news for predictive modeling, is a major stumbling block in this field. Our model using a Random Forest Classifier achieves an accuracy of 94.87% using a combination of features such as n-grams, shallow syntax, tf-idf and a novel online relevance score feature. For the same model we achieve a Balanced Error Rate(BER) score of 0.115. These promising results encourages us to probe further into this issue to eliminate fraud through fake news.
